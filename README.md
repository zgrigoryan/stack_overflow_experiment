# Stack Overflow Exploration Program

This program explores the behavior of **stack overflows** by declaring a very large local array and attempting to allocate memory beyond the system's stack size limit. The program helps in understanding what happens when the stack size is exceeded, leading to a **segmentation fault**.

## Program Overview

The program tries to allocate a large local array (`int array[100000000]`), which requires approximately **400MB of memory**. On systems with a limited stack size (e.g., macOS with ~8MB stack), this will likely cause a **stack overflow**, triggering a segmentation fault.

### Key Concepts:
- **Stack memory**: A region of memory where local variables are allocated. Its size is limited by the operating system.
- **Segmentation fault**: Occurs when a program tries to access memory that is outside of its allowed memory region, such as when stack space is exhausted.

### Code Breakdown:
- **Array Declaration**: Declares a large local array (`int array[100000000]`), which likely exceeds the available stack size.
- **Stack Address**: The program prints the address of the array to show where itâ€™s located in the stack.
- **Array Usage**: The program populates and prints the first 10 elements of the array to prevent the compiler from optimizing the array allocation away.

## Build & Run Instructions

### 1. **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have **C++ compiler** installed:
- **macOS**: You can use `clang++`, which comes with Xcode Command Line Tools.
- **Linux**: Use `g++` or `clang++`.
- **Windows**: You can use MSVC or MinGW.

### 2. **Compiling the Program**

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.cpp` file.

For **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o stack_overflow_program
```

For **Windows (MSVC)**:

```bash
cl main.cpp
```

### 3. **Running the Program**

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./stack_overflow_program
```

For **Windows**:

```bash
stack_overflow_program.exe
```

### 4. **Check Stack Size** (macOS only)

You can check your **stack size** with the following command:

```bash
ulimit -s
```
On most systems, this will output something like `8192` or `8176` KB, which is roughly **8MB**.


One way to change the limit is by using the command:

```bash 
ulimit -s 65532  # Increase stack size (64MB)
```

However, you might receive a message: 
- 'ulimit: value exceeds hard limit'

## Ouput example

You are likely to get the following output:

- zsh: segmentation fault  ./executable_name 

The segmentation fault happens because the program is trying to allocate too much memory on the stack. Since stack space is limited, you quickly exceed it and hit the overflow.

- To experiment further:
- Start with smaller arrays.
- Use recursion to trigger stack overflow.
- Optionally, increase the stack size temporarily to test larger arrays.
- Compare heap vs. stack memory allocation.

*When array size is reduced, this output is printed: *

```
Attempting to allocate a large local array on the stack...
Heap address of array: 0x120008000
Successfully allocated array of size 1000000 on heap.
Attempting to allocate a large local array on the stack...
Stack address of array: 0x16af5a6e8
Successfully allocated array of size 1000000 on stack.
```

One interesting observation we can make here is the address of the array when it's allocated on the heap vs the stack. It is visible that the heap allocation gets lower addresses, while the stack memory allocation takes addresses higher in the memory.

## Conclusion

This program helps in understanding how stack overflows occur when you exceed the system's stack size limit. It provides insight into the importance of memory management in software development and how systems handle overflow situations. For advanced learning, explore dynamic memory allocation, recursion, signal handling, and cross-platform memory differences.
